    content: `To my dearest girl, Maria,

To date, we’ve been together for just a little over a month, and I’ve been thinking about what kind of gift I should prepare for you. I told myself it had to be something special and sweet, because that’s exactly how you’ve always treated me.

I know I’m not always the most meticulous guy, and I want to apologize for that, because you deserve so much more. It honestly hurts me to learn that ever since you moved to the U.S., your motivation to celebrate your birthday has faded for various reasons. That’s why I wanted to give you something that might bring back a little of that happiness and excitement.

I want to give you a gift that isn’t just a moment, but a feeling, something that holds the warmth and care you’ve quietly given to others, and to me. So I decided to write to you, to capture the little pieces of thought and emotion that words can hold. These letters are my way of storing what often overflows when I think of you, and I’ll give them all to you on your birthday.

I want to make you happy, not because I want you to like me more,
but because in your heart, there’s a home for mine. ❤️

    content: `Dear Maria,

Thank you for being a part of my life and for giving me so much love and support. The little details you do, they warm my heart and bring me so much joy. I could name so many.

I still remember the first time you made me breakfast. I had to get to the office really early that day and mentioned it to you the night before. I expected to quietly get up and try not to wake you, but of course, you being you, so caring and thoughtful, got up just as early to see me off. What truly surprised me was finding one of the most delicious breakfasts waiting for me while I was getting ready. You didn’t have to do that, and I wish you knew how much I appreciated it. I would’ve shown more gratitude if I hadn’t to rush to work.

Little things like that add up. You always bring me a bottle of water when I’m about to pull out of the garage. Every time I ask, “What are we having for lunch or dinner?” you almost instantly reply with your classic line, “What do you want?”, like a auto-reply bot lol.

All these small gestures remind me how lucky I am to have you, how deeply you care in ways that words can’t always express.

Thank you, my dearest girl, thank you for your acts of love. ❤️`,

    content: `Dear Maria,

Remember the night we had an argument? It was during one of our usual FaceTime calls. For some reason, I brought up how I felt like I was getting too attached. I think what I really wanted to say was that you were becoming more and more important to me, but I said it the wrong way. It came out like I wasn’t content with myself for spending so much time with you.

I’m so sorry.

I used to be very frugal when it came to giving my time to others. To me, time has always been the most precious thing in the world, more valuable than money, achievements, or anything else, because we can never earn it back.

But today, I want to tell you this, my dearest girl: 
You’ve changed the priorities of my heart.
I love you so much that you’ve become more important than my time.
And thank you, for giving so much of yours to me. ❤️

    content: `Dear Maria,

Thank you for being in my life, for being my favorite person.

You know my story, and you know the background I grew up with. I didn’t receive much love, and for a long time, I didn’t really know how to love either. It took me years to grow past traumas, to understand it, to try to forgive it, and to learn how to love.

And then you stepped into my life, at the right time, in the right place.

I still remember the little things that showed me just how much you care. Like the time I casually complained that my straw might get dirty if I kept reusing it, and the next time I saw you, you had quietly bought straw toppers for me. And the car playlist you made for me on Spotify, perfectly tailored for my drives.

Babe, if you ever feel like I’ve stopped loving you, please remind me of these moments, these moments that mean so much to me. They’re the parts of my life that I feel so fortunate to have, the things I never take for granted.

Because with you, I’ve found the place where I heal. ❤️

I’m sorry for making you frustrated tonight. It hurts me to see you stressing about your GPA and your exams. I want you to know this, you are not defined by your grades. You are so much more than your parents' expectations, more than what job you have, more than how much money you earn.

I understand that you have goals and that they matter to you. And I admire that about you. But to me, above everything else, I just want you to be happy. That’s what I care about the most.

I’m sorry if I ruined your night, I never want to be the reason you feel worse. So let me make it up to you. I’ll take you to Nashville tomorrow and give you a night that brings your smile back.

Because at the end of the day, you matter to me. ❤️

    content: `Dear Maria,

We’ve been together for a while now, and I’m thankful for you every single day. I always tell myself not to take anything you do for granted, but I think I failed today.

I got a little jealous, and I hate that about myself. I hate that I didn’t fully appreciate your love and let insecurity took over this time.

When you mentioned that your coworker Jacob is actually really smart, not like how your manager described him, I felt a tiny bit jealous inside. I didn’t dare tell you, because I didn’t want to make you feel responsible for my insecurity. So I’m writing it here instead, hoping that by the time you read this letter, I’ve already worked on myself and overcome it.

My girl, I really want to be a better person for you, a more mature, stable, loving man, because you deserve every bit of that and more.

And I promise, I’m becoming better for you. ❤️`,

Thank you for going go-karting with me and visiting the Corvette Museum the other day. I know go-karting isn’t really your thing, and you’re not a big fan of cars either. But you still came with me, and that’s when it really hit me.

I’m starting to realize how my hobbies are slowly becoming our hobbies.
My routines becoming our routines.
My goals becoming our goals.

My girl, you always try your best to accommodate me. You always ask what I want for dinner, how I want to plan the weekend. You give so much of yourself without ever asking for anything back.

I hope I learn to give you the same warmth you give me. I hope I can pay back everything you’ve poured into me. And I hope I always love you like how you love me, in all the little ways. ❤️`,

I had another great day with you this weekend. We went to the breakout room and then had KPOT & BBQ, and days like this are slowly becoming my favorite kind of routine.

I’ve been eating out a lot recently, and I can definitely tell I’m gaining weight, lol. But you know what? I don’t feel bad about it at all. Maybe it’s because my mind is so filled with happiness that I don’t even have time to grieve my six-pack, haha.

There’s a Chinese phrase called “幸福肥,” which means when you start gaining a little weight in a new relationship, it’s a sign you found the right person. And honestly,I feel that. I really feel that with you.

I think I got my right one. ❤️`,

I’ve recently become a Christian and placed my faith in Jesus Christ. You’ve been there with me through every step of this spiritual journey, and I truly appreciate that more than I can express.

I love how we watch The Chosen together every single day, how we talk about each episode, how we both have our favorite disciples. Mine is Simon Peter, and yours is Andrew. These little moments mean so much to me.

I know my sudden conversion surprised you, but in this letter, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for supporting me unconditionally, for guiding me with patience, and for inviting Christ into our relationship with an open heart.

I love you, and I’m grateful that we get to walk this path together in faith. ❤️`,

You are the best sister I have ever seen. Truly.
Franzyn is an active, lovely, and incredibly cute kid, and beyond that, she’s a fortunate one. She’s lucky because she has a sister like you.

I always admire the patience you have with her, and the way you stay calm and gentle even when she gets grumpy or unreasonable. You always manage to be the bigger person.

I know I’ve mentioned before that there are some flaws in your parents’ approach to parenting, and sometimes I’ve expressed concern when I saw how you reacted in the harder moments, when she cried or rebelled. But honestly? I don’t think I could ever match the level of patience and love you show her.

You’re doing the best you possibly can.
I just want you to know this, clearly and proudly:
you are the best sister in the world.

    content: `Dear Maria,

I think you’re going to be an amazing mom one day, patient, loving, and meticulously caring. I already see those qualities in the way you raise Lucky and walk him every morning and every night.

I still remember the night Lucky had diarrhea in the middle of the night. I was the first one to smell something funky, and shame on me, I was too lazy to get up and help. You on the other hand, you acted like an officer reporting to an emergency. You immediately grabbed the cleaners, fixed the mess, even comforted Lucky, and fed him his meds, all in the middle of the night, without complaining once.

Yes, we’ve talked about getting another dog someday, hopefully a Shiba, but bebe, I’ll be honest. I don’t know if I could ever care for a dog as well as you do unless you’re there with me. Because of you, I have so much more confidence in myself. ❤️

Remember the first time you made me that incredible banana bread? Your baking skills are other worldly. Every time I leave your place, you always make sure I’m going home with something nice you’ve made, it’s either chocolate cookies, protein pancakes, or whatever I was craving about.

And you’re always so thoughtful about it too, no added sugar, zero-calorie sweeteners, extra protein, all tailored just for me. And I hope you don't mind how I always brag about you doing meal preps for me to my friends. I appreciate all of it more than I can say, and I hope I never take any of it for granted.

If I ever forget, just remind me of these moments, the care behind every delicious bite.

Every treat you make is a taste of your love. ❤️

Do you remember that time before we were even officially together, when you went to Lexington with me to help me move out from my old apartment? I still think about how you carried me cleaning the place, met my friends (even though they were all speaking Chinese and you didn’t understand a word). 

And remember when I was about to throw out that old furniture? You had the amazing idea to put it on Facebook Marketplace, and we actually sold it for 70 bucks. I’ll never forget how we celebrated with that amazing meal at the authentic Chinese restaurant afterward. It was such a simple moment, but so meaningful, and it showed me how thoughtful, supportive, and naturally loving you are.

That day motivated me. It made me realize how much I wanted to be with you, not just then, but for a long, long time.

Here’s to that day, and all the delightful moments that led us here.
Because, my dearest girl you had me then. ❤️
