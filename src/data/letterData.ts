    content: `To my dearest girl, Maria,

To date, we’ve been together for just a little over a month, and I’ve been thinking about what kind of gift I should prepare for you. I told myself it had to be something special and sweet, because that’s exactly how you’ve always treated me.

I know I’m not always the most meticulous guy, and I want to apologize for that, because you deserve so much more. It honestly hurts me to know that ever since you moved to the U.S., your motivation to celebrate your birthday has faded for various reasons. That’s why I wanted to give you something that might bring back a little of that light, something meaningful and heartfelt.

I want to give you a gift that isn’t just a moment, but a feeling, something that holds the warmth and care you’ve quietly given to others, and to me. So I decided to write to you, to capture the little pieces of thought and emotion that words can hold. These letters are my way of storing what often overflows when I think of you, and I’ll give them all to you on your birthday.

I want to make you happy, not because I want you to like me more,
but because in your heart, there’s a home for mine. ❤️

    content: `Dear Maria,

Thank you for being a part of my life and for giving me so much love and support. The little details you do, they warm my heart and bring me so much joy. I could name so many.

I still remember the first time you made me breakfast. I had to get to the office really early that day and mentioned it to you the night before. I expected to quietly get up and try not to wake you, but of course, you being you, so caring and thoughtful, got up just as early to see me off. What truly surprised me was finding one of the most delicious breakfasts waiting for me while I was getting ready. You didn’t have to do that, and I wish you knew how much I appreciated it. I would’ve shown more gratitude if I hadn’t to rush to work.

Little things like that add up. You always bring me a bottle of water when I’m about to pull out of the garage. Every time I ask, “What are we having for lunch or dinner?” you almost instantly reply with your classic line, “What do you want?”, like a auto-reply bot lol.

All these small gestures remind me how lucky I am to have you, how deeply you care in ways that words can’t always express.

Thank you, my dearest girl, thank you for your acts of love.`,
